# LAB - Creating a reminders and tasks app with Kotlin.

Project: creation of a `To do list` App

## Challenge
To make the application resilient, which does not lose the saved tasks when it is terminated, for this it is possible to use the strategy of saving the data locally.
This can be done in two ways: using [Shared Preferences](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences?hl=pt-br) or [SQLite](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/sqlite) to use these concepts in an easy way you should use the following libraries:

 - [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room): is a database that offers an abstraction layer over SQLite, helping to better deal with its complexity.

 - [DataStore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore?hl=pt-br): is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects.
